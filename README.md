WealthSimple

* When was the company incorporated?

September 2014

* Who are the founders of the company? 

Michael Katchen

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Prior to founding Wealthsimple, Michael Katchen worked for 1000Memories, a Silicon Valley-based startup. After Ancestry.com bought 1000Memories in 2012, Katchen developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios. Interest in the spreadsheet helped inspire the idea for Wealthsimple. Katchen started investing at an early age and understood the importance and benefits of investing and building portfolios at a young age. So a part of his idea was also to focus on and get milennials to do the same.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

It initially raised financing from investors Eric Kirzner, Joe Canavan, and Roger Martin in May of 2014. In April 2015 and 2016, the company received a total of $30 million in Series A funding from Power Financial Corporation. And through these 7 years, Wealthsimple has received over CAD 380 million in funding. Recently they raised another $114 million from investors like TCV, a Menlo Park, Calif.-based equity investor, alongside other U.S.-based venture fund companies such as Greylock Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, Two Sigma Ventures Investments, and an existing investor, Munich-based Allianz X.

It’s mainly focused on Millenials. About 42% of millennial are into investing these days and market size is massive.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

No minimum account balance, free portfolio analysis, multiple SRIs, as well as a halal-investing portfolio which complies with Islamic law is a standout offering. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The technologies Wealthsimple is currently using are: Java, React, React Native, Redux, Ruby, Google Drive, ES6, Bootstrap, AWS Lambda, Hibernate, Amazon RDS, Amazon Cloudfront, Oracle, Github, Git, Docker, Ansible, Nomad, VirtualBox, Gulp, Circle CI, Rundeck, Slack, Jira, Zendesk, 1 Password, Azure Active Directory, Quip, TensorFlow, Postman,  Amazon Route 53, Amazon SNS, Algolia, AWS Data Pipeline, Periscope. 

WealthSimple is using this technology to help build customer's portfolios because, historically, it's way more effective than having a human being picking stocks.  The algorithms behind their trading philosophy are designed by really smart human beings and then the technology takes over and removes all the biases that human behavior can bring in. They design the system and then automate the decisions because with computers, the emotional element (in human beings) attached to investing is not involved. It's a combination of human element with technology.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
WealthSimple does not offer credit or debit cards to it's customers so in order to access funds, customers are required to transfer them from WealthSimple to a different financial instituition first which can be a bit inconvenient at times. So I would definitely advise them to do this.

Easy access to funds is very appealing to customers and would appeal to a larger pool of people who like easy banking.

Chip card technology—also known as chip-and-PIN or EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa).

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

This technology is appropriate because customers have been using it for years and it's easy to use.
